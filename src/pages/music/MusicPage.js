Gamelan are gong orchestra’s from South East Asia and my journey has been guiding me to Indonesia since 2008. Here I’ve been overwhelmed by the richness of Indonesian culture and the kindness of the people. Though sharing a long history Indonesia is very different from the Netherlands.

In the Netherlands 2008 were the days when Dubstep was roaming the dancefloor and I was heavily influenced by sub heavy music and Sound System culture. It was also the year when I first started going to Indonesia where I went on a mission to make field recordings.

At that time mp3 players contained about 512 MB so I had to choose my music very carefully. With Amon Tobin, Digital Mystikz, Vex’d and similar artist locked in my headphones I made field recordings over the course of a year and in my head this music started fusing with Indonesian culture.

These influences combined inspired the foundation to the music."
